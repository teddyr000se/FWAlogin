						<li>Wireless Internet access at the Fort Wayne International Airport is provided at no cost to the passengers and guest of the airport (the Service). Because a Free Wi-Fi Network is setup for the various ways that a user may need to use it, the Service is inherently unsecure and the privacy and security of data transmissions cannot be guaranteed. Proceeding to the Internet from this page is an acknowledgement that the Service is not secure, and that you understand wireless communications can be intercepted by equipment and software designed for that purpose.</li></br>
						<li>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, with no warranties whatsoever. In no event will Fort Wayne Allen County Airport Authority or Indiana Data Center or their representatives be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or any damages associated with your use of the Service. No advice given by these organizations or their representative shall create a warranty. The user assumes all responsibility and risk associated with the use of the Service; and it is the user's responsibility to provide whatever security is needed on their own device.</li>
